## User Story & Dashboard Requirements
This user story outlines the specifications for creating three dashboards using PowerBI to assist the sales & marketing, accounting & finance and student services teams to analyse their historical performance.

## Key Requirements
The Sales and Marketing team requires a dashboard that presents the year-on-year historical course fee revenues by study area, revenue channel and student nationality. The key purpose is to identify key areas to focus sales and marketing efforts.

The Accounting & Finance team requires a monthly snapshot of their receivables by customer group among other metrics. The key purpose is to manage receivables and boost collection efforts for overdue accounts.

The Student Services team requires current information on students by course level, residency status and age group. The key purpose is to plan operations ahead for the next term. For example, staffing and housing requirements. 

### Revenue Report

- Include a figure of the current revenues and a comparison check from the previous year
